Cutting edge feature:

Animated Splash Screen:

In manifest the start_url could point to a new app (set of pages / features)
with the splash screen animation on DOMcontentload
  - Use AMP for pages (definitely landing page)

Goals:

1. Download to homescreen - Make all parts of this perfect
  - download request from user
  - app load time / animation
  - icons for devices

  2. We mirror the image loaded by app icon
